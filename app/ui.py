        ### How to use this app
        1. Upload a PDF document containing lecture notes or study materials
        2. Wait for the document to be processed (this may take a few moments)
        3. Ask questions about the content in the text input below
        4. Get AI-generated answers based on your document content
        
        ### Troubleshooting
        - If you encounter a "readonly database" error, the app will automatically switch to using in-memory storage
        - In-memory storage works well but your document will need to be re-uploaded if you refresh the page
        - For best results, use PDFs with clear text content (not scanned images of text)
