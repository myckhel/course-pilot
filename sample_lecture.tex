\section{Introduction to AI}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

\section{Machine Learning Basics}
Machine Learning is a subset of AI focused on algorithms that improve automatically through experience. The main types are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled examples
    \item Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
    \item Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interactions with an environment
\end{itemize}

\section{Natural Language Processing}
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Key concepts include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tokenization: Breaking text into meaningful units
    \item Word Embeddings: Representing words as vectors in a continuous space
    \item Language Models: Systems that predict the likelihood of sequences of words
\end{itemize}
