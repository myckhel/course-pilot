## 🚀 Copilot Instructions for Flask API (Senior Level)

> ✅ Use Blueprints, Flask-RESTful (or Flask-RestX), SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow, JWT Auth, environment config, and type hints throughout.

### 🔧 Project Structure

```python
# Generate a scalable Flask API structure using Blueprints.
# Separate concerns by creating directories: `routes`, `models`, `schemas`, `services`, `config`, `auth`.
# Use application factory pattern for initialization and register extensions inside `extensions.py`.
```

### 🔐 Authentication

```python
# Implement JWT-based authentication using Flask-JWT-Extended.
# Create routes for login and registration.
# Hash passwords using bcrypt and return tokens securely.
```

### 🧱 Models (SQLAlchemy)

```python
# Define a SQLAlchemy model `User` with fields: id (primary key), username (unique), email (unique), and password (hashed).
# Add created_at and updated_at with automatic timestamping using SQLAlchemy events.
```

### 🧪 Validation (Marshmallow)

```python
# Create a Marshmallow schema `UserSchema` with field validation and serialization.
# Include `load_only` for password and `dump_only` for timestamps.
```

### 📦 API Endpoints

```python
# Create a RESTful resource `UserResource` using Flask-RESTful.
# Add GET (retrieve single user), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE methods.
# Validate payloads with Marshmallow, handle exceptions gracefully.
```

### ⚙️ Config & Initialization

```python
# Set up a `config.py` with class-based configuration: DevelopmentConfig, ProductionConfig.
# Use `.env` variables via python-dotenv to manage secrets.
# Load config via `create_app()` and environment selection.
```

### 🛠 Error Handling

```python
# Define custom error handlers for 400, 401, 404, and 500.
# Return JSON responses with consistent format: { "error": "message" }.
```

### 🧪 Testing

```python
# Write Pytest unit tests for the User model and API routes.
# Use a test database and fixtures to isolate test environments.
```

### 🧼 Linting & Tooling

```text
# Set up Black for formatting, Flake8 for linting, and MyPy for type checking.
# Add a Makefile or tasks.py to automate common commands (e.g., run, test, lint).
```

### ✅ Example Full Copilot Instruction (Multiline Comment)

```python
"""
Create a Flask REST API using Flask-RESTful for managing users.
- Define User model with id, username, email, password
- Use Marshmallow for schema validation
- Secure passwords with bcrypt
- Add JWT authentication with login and protected routes
- Return paginated results for GET /users
- Use application factory and Blueprints for modular structure
